        The condition number measures how well the constraint matrix is conditioned

        constraints, the resolution is slow because of repeated singularities.

        The rule of thumb to interpret the condition number kappa is:
          - o kappa <= 1e7: virtually no chance of numerical issues
          - o 1e7 < kappa <= 1e10: small chance of numerical issues
          - o 1e10 < kappa <= 1e13: medium chance of numerical issues
          - o kappa > 1e13: high chance of numerical issues

    - Add the new Foo parameter in the DoubleParam or IntegerParam enum.
    - If it is a categorical param, add a FooValues enum.
    - Decide if the wrapper should define a default value for it: yes
      if it controls the properties of the solution (example:
      tolerances) or if it consistently improves performance, no
      otherwise. If yes, define kDefaultFoo.
    - Add a foo_value_ member and, if no default value is defined, a
      foo_is_default_ member.
    - Add code to handle Foo in Set...Param, Reset...Param,
      Get...Param, Reset and the constructor.
    - In class MPSolverInterface, add a virtual method SetFoo, add it
      to SetCommonParameters or SetMIPParameters, and implement it for
      each solver. Sometimes, parameters need to be implemented
      differently, see for example the INCREMENTALITY implementation.

    instead. We need to figure out how to deal with the subtleties of
    the default values.
