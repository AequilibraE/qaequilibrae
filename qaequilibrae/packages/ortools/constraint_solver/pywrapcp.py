    Solver Class

    A solver represents the main computation engine. It implements the entire
    range of Constraint Programming protocols:
      - Reversibility
      - Propagation
      - Search

    Usually, Constraint Programming code consists of
      - the creation of the Solver,
      - the creation of the decision variables of the model,
      - the creation of the constraints of the model and their addition to the
        solver() through the AddConstraint() method,
      - the creation of the main DecisionBuilder class,
      - the launch of the solve() method with the decision builder.

    For the time being, Solver is neither MT_SAFE nor MT_HOT.

        Adds the constraint 'c' to the model.

        After calling this method, and until there is a backtrack that undoes the
        addition, any assignment of variables to values must satisfy the given
        constraint in order to be considered feasible. There are two fairly
        different use cases:

        - the most common use case is modeling: the given constraint is really
        part of the problem that the user is trying to solve. In this use case,
        AddConstraint is called outside of search (i.e., with state() ==
        OUTSIDE_SEARCH). Most users should only use AddConstraint in this
        way. In this case, the constraint will belong to the model forever: it
        cannot be removed by backtracking.

        - a rarer use case is that 'c' is not a real constraint of the model. It
        may be a constraint generated by a branching decision (a constraint whose
        goal is to restrict the search space), a symmetry breaking constraint (a
        constraint that does restrict the search space, but in a way that cannot
        have an impact on the quality of the solutions in the subtree), or an
        inferred constraint that, while having no semantic value to the model (it
        does not restrict the set of solutions), is worth having because we
        believe it may strengthen the propagation. In these cases, it happens
        that the constraint is added during the search (i.e., with state() ==
        IN_SEARCH or state() == IN_ROOT_NODE). When a constraint is
        added during a search, it applies only to the subtree of the search tree
        rooted at the current node, and will be automatically removed by
        backtracking.

        This method does not take ownership of the constraint. If the constraint
        has been created by any factory method (Solver::MakeXXX), it will
        automatically be deleted. However, power users who implement their own
        constraints should do: solver.AddConstraint(solver.RevAlloc(new
        MyConstraint(...));

    The behavior of the LocalSearchOperator class is similar to iterators.
    The operator is synchronized with an assignment (gives the
    current values of the variables); this is done in the Start() method.

    Then one can iterate over the neighbors using the MakeNextNeighbor method.
    This method returns an assignment which represents the incremental changes
    to the current solution. It also returns a second assignment representing
    the changes to the last solution defined by the neighborhood operator; this
    assignment is empty if the neighborhood operator cannot track this
    information.

    Local Search Filters are used for fast neighbor pruning.
    Filtering a move is done in several phases:
    - in the Relax phase, filters determine which parts of their internals
      will be changed by the candidate, and modify intermediary State
    - in the Accept phase, filters check that the candidate is feasible,
    - if the Accept phase succeeds, the solver may decide to trigger a
      Synchronize phase that makes filters change their internal representation
      to the last candidate,
    - otherwise (Accept fails or the solver does not want to synchronize),
      a Revert phase makes filters erase any intermediary State generated by the
      Relax and Accept phases.
    A given filter has phases called with the following pattern:
    (Relax.Accept.Synchronize | Relax.Accept.Revert | Relax.Revert)*.

    Manager for any NodeIndex <-> variable index conversion. The routing solver

    are tricky to manage directly because one Node can correspond to a multitude
    of variables, depending on the number of times they appear in the model, and
    if they're used as start and/or end points. This class aims to simplify
    variable index usage, allowing users to use NodeIndex instead.

    Usage:

      .. code-block:: c++

          auto starts_ends = ...;  /// These are NodeIndex.
          RoutingIndexManager manager(10, 4, starts_ends);  // 10 nodes, 4 vehicles.
          RoutingModel model(manager);

    Then, use 'manager.NodeToIndex(node)' whenever model requires a variable
    index.

    Note: the mapping between node indices and variables indices is subject to
    change so no assumption should be made on it. The only guarantee is that
    indices range between 0 and n-1, where n = number of vehicles * 2 (for start
    and end nodes) + number of non-start or end nodes.

        Model creation
        Methods to add dimensions to routes; dimensions represent quantities
        accumulated at nodes along the routes. They represent quantities such as
        weights or volumes carried along the route, or distance or times.
        Quantities at a node are represented by "cumul" variables and the increase
        or decrease of quantities between nodes are represented by "transit"
        variables. These variables are linked as follows:
        if j == next(i), cumul(j) = cumul(i) + transit(i, j) + slack(i)
        where slack is a positive slack variable (can represent waiting times for
        a time dimension).
        Setting the value of fix_start_cumul_to_zero to true will force the
        "cumul" variable of the start node of all vehicles to be equal to 0.
        Creates a dimension where the transit variable is constrained to be
        equal to evaluator(i, next(i)); 'slack_max' is the upper bound of the
        slack variable and 'capacity' is the upper bound of the cumul variables.

    - 3 nodes A, UV and AR of type T3, respectively with type policies
      TYPE_ADDED_TO_VEHICLE, TYPE_ON_VEHICLE_UP_TO_VISIT and
      TYPE_SIMULTANEOUSLY_ADDED_AND_REMOVED
    the configurations
    UV --> a1 --> r1 --> a2 --> r2,   a1 --> r1 --> a2 --> r2 --> A and
    a1 --> r1 --> AR --> a2 --> r2 are acceptable, whereas the configurations
    a1 --> a2 --> r1 --> ..., or A --> a1 --> r1 --> ..., or
    a1 --> r1 --> UV --> ... are not feasible.

    It also verifies same-vehicle and temporal type requirements.
    A node of type T_d with a same-vehicle requirement for type T_r needs to be
    served by the same vehicle as a node of type T_r.
    Temporal requirements, on the other hand, can take effect either when the
    dependent type is being added to the route or when it's removed from it,
    which is determined by the dependent node's VisitTypePolicy.
    In the above example:
    - If T3 is required on the same vehicle as T1, A, AR or UV must be on the
      same vehicle as a1.
    - If T2 is required when adding T1, a2 must be visited *before* a1, and if
      r2 is also visited on the route, it must be *after* a1, i.e. T2 must be on
      the vehicle when a1 is visited:
      ... --> a2 --> ... --> a1 --> ... --> r2 --> ...
    - If T3 is required when removing T1, T3 needs to be on the vehicle when
      r1 is visited:
      ... --> A --> ... --> r1 --> ...   OR   ... --> r1 --> ... --> UV --> ...

    Dimensions represent quantities accumulated at nodes along the routes. They

    Quantities at a node are represented by "cumul" variables and the increase
    or decrease of quantities between nodes are represented by "transit"
    variables. These variables are linked as follows:

    if j == next(i),
    cumuls(j) = cumuls(i) + transits(i) + slacks(i) +
                state_dependent_transits(i)

    a time dimension), and state_dependent_transits is a non-purely functional
    version of transits_. Favour transits over state_dependent_transits when
    possible, because purely functional callbacks allow more optimisations and
